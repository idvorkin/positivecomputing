The positive computing book has some very helpful models to guide our thinking, I'll paste restate them here:

Approach to making user happier 
==

|Approach | Description | Example
| ---------| :----  |:--|
| None  | Happiness  ignored | Most applications today - no attempt to make users happy |
| Passive (reactive) | As issues are found which effect happiness, features are redesigned  | Comment systems allowing anonymous comments. As anonymous comments filled with negativity, comment systems evolved to force a user identity, and to block  "bad" users. **[TBD: Get a better example]**	| 
| Active | Augmenting existing features to make users happier | Bing home page - displaying beautiful images that makes users happy. |
| Deliberate | The goal of the feature is user happiness exclusively | Happify- a tool to train users ot be happier|
